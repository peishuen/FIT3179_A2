                <h2>From Slowdown to Strong Comeback</h2>
                <p>
                    Before the pandemic, Malaysia’s economic growth was already moderating as global trade softened. When 2020 struck, strict 
                    lockdowns froze domestic activity and triggered the nation’s first GDP contraction in more than two decades. Yet within 
                    two years, the economy staged a strong rebound, lifted by reopened borders, renewed exports, and returning consumer demand. 
                    This reveals how Malaysia’s trade-driven economy could recover rapidly once mobility and global connections resumed.

                <h2>Jobs Lost, Then Slowly Regained</h2>    
                <p>
                    The onset of COVID-19 in 2020 caused a sharp and immediate rise in unemployment. After years of stability, Malaysia’s job 
                    market was shaken as restrictions forced widespread closures, especially in the service and tourism sectors. As movement 
                    controls eased, employment gradually recovered and confidence returned, though recovery remained uneven across industries. 
                    This shows that Malaysia’s labour rebound after COVID-19 was powered as much by renewed optimism and reopening as by direct job creation.

                <h2>Uneven Impacts Across the Nation</h2>
                <p>
                    Not all states felt the pandemic equally. While most of Peninsular Malaysia maintained mid-range unemployment levels, Sabah recorded 
                    the steepest rise as tourism collapsed and mobility was restricted. These differences reflected how each state’s economic base 
                    influenced its ability to withstand the downturn. This reveals how Malaysia’s regional diversity shaped resilience, with states 
                    reliant on tourism and external trade being hit hardest.

                <h2>Recovery at Different Speeds</h2>
                <p>
                    By 2023, growth had returned across most states, but the pace varied. Johor, Melaka, and Pahang saw faster rebounds, supported by 
                    construction activity and cross-border projects linked to Singapore. In contrast, others continued to trail behind as domestic 
                    demand and exports recovered more slowly. This shows that Malaysia’s post-COVID recovery unfolded unevenly, reflecting each 
                    state’s economic strengths and exposure to regional trade flows.

                <h2>A Shift in What Became Expensive</h2>
                <p>
                    As the economy reopened, the main drivers of inflation shifted. Dining and accommodation costs rose quickly as social life 
                    resumed, while health expenses climbed with greater demand for medical care and products. Meanwhile, housing and utilities 
                    saw gentler price increases, easing pressure on essential costs of living. This reveals how changing lifestyles and 
                    consumption patterns redefined Malaysia’s post-pandemic inflation trends.

                <h2>Trade Flows Interrupted, Then Revived</h2>
                <p>
                    Malaysia’s role in global trade was severely disrupted in 2020, when border closures and supply chain breakdowns slowed 
                    both exports and imports. Once restrictions lifted, trade flows rebounded rapidly, returning to near pre-pandemic levels 
                    as international demand recovered. This shows that Malaysia’s resilience stemmed from the same openness that once made 
                    it vulnerable, as global reconnection became the key engine of its revival.
